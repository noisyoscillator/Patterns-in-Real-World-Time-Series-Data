# Patterns-in-Real-World-Time-Series-Data
A research project published in a peer-reviewed journal that was coded in Python which analyzed and graphed patterns in real-world time series data taken from the World Bank database.

The main data scientist is Kamaludin Dingle along with Boumediene Hamzi and Rafiq Kamal.

The below is the abstract from the published paper:
Is it possible to forecast a time series without first fitting to historical data? Here we use
results derived from algorithmic information theory to make generic forecasts of series patterns
in real-world time series taken from the World Bank Open Data project. We find evidence of
simplicity bias - an exponential upper bound decay in probability with pattern complexity - in
these series, and make a priori predictions regarding the probabilities of certain discretised series
patterns arising in the data. Hence we perform a kind of forecasting without training data. We
examine di erent discretisation methods, and compare them  nding that not all methods yield
the same results. Finally we make predictions about which of two discretised series is more likely
with accuracy up  85%, considerably higher than a 50% baseline rate. Simplicity bias has been
studied in several fields including biology, physics, and engineering models, and here we expand the
empirical study and application to time series, thus potentially opening a new perspective on time
series analysis.
